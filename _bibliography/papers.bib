  abstract={Classification of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) into adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is essential to select the appropriate treatment for the patient. However, most machine learning approaches require many detailed annotations of whole slide images. We propose to use Neural Image Compression (NIC), which requires only slide-level labels, to classify NSCLC. We show that NIC approaches state of the art performance on lung classification when trained on >2,000 slides from the TCGA and TCIA databases. The models reach AUCs in the range 0.84-0.98 on several internal and external cohorts.},
