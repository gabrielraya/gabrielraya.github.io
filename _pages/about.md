I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Machine Learning at Tilburg University & TU/e working on the intersection of <b>explicit deep generative models</b>, <b>causality</b>, and <b>reinforcement learning</b>.<br><br>

Previous to my Ph.D., I obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.ru.nl/english/">Radboud University</a>, where I researched unsupervised out-of-distribution detection applied to digital pathology with <a href="https://www.twanvl.nl/">Twan van Laarhoven</a>  and
<a href="https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/members/jasper-linmans/">Jasper Linmans</a>.
I was a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/">Computational Pathology Group</a> of the <a href="https://www.radboudumc.nl/patientenzorg">Radboud University Medical Center</a>, where I did research on deep learning to analyze histopathology images with <a href="https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/members/witali-aswolinskiy/">Witali Aswolinskiy</a> and <a href="https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/members/francesco-ciompi/">Francesco Ciompi</a>.
