I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Machine Learning at Tilburg University & TU/e, and a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://www.ru.nl/donders/">Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour</a>, working under the guidance of <a href="https://www.artcogsys.com/team/luca">Luca Ambrogioni</a>. My research focuses on probabilistic deep generative models, with a special interest in diffusion models. I am particularly interested in integrating concepts from statistical physics and critical phenomena to enhance our understanding of particle generation and the emergence of complex phenomena. This interdisciplinary approach not only deepens our understanding of generative models but also sheds light on the intricate processes underlying complex systems in nature.

Previous to my Ph.D., I obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.ru.nl/english/">Radboud University</a>, where I researched unsupervised out-of-distribution detection applied to digital pathology with <a href="https://www.twanvl.nl/">Twan van Laarhoven</a>  and
<a href="https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/members/jasper-linmans/">Jasper Linmans</a>.
I was a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/">Computational Pathology Group</a> of the <a href="https://www.radboudumc.nl/patientenzorg">Radboud University Medical Center</a>, where I did research on deep learning to analyze histopathology images with <a href="https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/members/witali-aswolinskiy/">Witali Aswolinskiy</a> and <a href="https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/members/francesco-ciompi/">Francesco Ciompi</a>.
