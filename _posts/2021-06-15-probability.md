Generative modeling is about understanding the mechanisms that generated the data. The levels of modeling can be statistical, causal, physical <d-cite key="scholkopf2019causality"></d-cite>  and probably even beyond these. In this post, I will focus only on explicit generative models.


The main idea of a probabilistic deep generative model is to learn the underlying distribution that generated the data given a set of examples from $$p(X)$$. This process is what in statistics is called density estimation or parameter estimation. We all know that statistics is sometimes know as the inverse probability.

This is a key property I want to emphasize here. The concept of probability theory or a probability space is defined from *any experiment involving **randomness***. The key word here is **experiment**!. In contrast, once we have data we don't know anything else about that **experiment** anymore, therefore loosing any possible information that might have influence the generative process of the data!.



Most of the current state of the art deep generative models

In this post, I will just emphasize on the importance of thinking about the mathematical properties when we speak about probabilities.


When building a generative model we want to estimate the join .

One framework we use to thinking about this uncertainty is probability theory. We think of probability spaces!

- $$ \Omega $$ The set of possible outcomes
- $$\mathcal{F}$$
- $$P$$
$$M^2$$
